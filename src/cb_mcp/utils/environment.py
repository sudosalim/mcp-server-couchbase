"""Environment introspection for diagnostic logging.

Emits a single DEBUG record on server start summarising the OS, Python
runtime, MCP server version, key dependency versions, transport, effective
log level, and a redacted view of the server configuration.

Intended audience: customer support. When a user reports an issue, asking
them to enable DEBUG logging will produce this record with most of the
context needed to triage — no further back-and-forth required.

The config redaction mirrors the policy of the ``get_server_configuration_status``
MCP tool (see :mod:`cb_mcp.tools.server`) and the provider's
``get_configuration`` so that the log file and the MCP tool output agree on
what's safe to expose. Secrets (passwords, certificate file paths) are
replaced with ``*_configured`` booleans; identifiers the user typed into
their config (connection_string) are logged verbatim.

    without regex gymnastics.

    MCP tool returns, so support engineers reading the log and tools reading
    the MCP response see the same shape and field names.

    server config is captured even at INFO (not only DEBUG) and survives
    rotation of the debug file. This dedicated file is only written when
    file-based logging is enabled (the ``file`` sink is active). Second, it is emitted as a
