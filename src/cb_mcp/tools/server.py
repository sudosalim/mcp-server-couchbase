    Unlike get_cluster_health_and_services (which actively pings each service right now),
    this reports the SDK's own cached connection state without performing any network I/O.
    It's cheap enough to call frequently, but it's only as fresh as the last time the SDK
    actually talked to each node — it won't proactively detect a service that just went down
    if nothing has touched it since. Use get_cluster_health_and_services instead when you need
    a live, right-now reachability check; there's also no way to filter this report to specific
    services the way that tool's ping can, since no I/O means nothing to filter.

    For each known endpoint, reports which service it belongs to, its remote/local addresses,
    connection state, and last_activity — how long it's been since that connection last saw
    traffic. Also reports an overall online/degraded/offline cluster state.

    This call makes no request to the server at all, so it needs no specific RBAC role beyond
    whatever the initial cluster connection already required — unlike an active ping, it isn't
    gated on KV/Query/Search or Cluster Admin privileges.
