Tools for key-value operations.

- get: Retrieve a document
- upsert: Insert or update a document (creates if not exists, updates if exists)
- insert: Create a document only if it does NOT exist (fails if exists)
- replace: Update a document only if it exists (fails if missing)
- delete: Remove a document

    sub-document operations. Use this instead of get_document_by_id when you only need
    a few fields, a presence check, or the size of an array/object inside a document —
    AND you already know the exact field path(s) to look up (e.g. from a prior
    get_document_by_id call on this same document, from the user explicitly naming the
    field, or from a known/confirmed schema for this collection).

    IMPORTANT: Do NOT guess field paths. If you don't already know the document's exact
    field names/structure, call get_document_by_id first (or instead) — a guessed path
    that doesn't exist returns a per-path error here rather than the real data, and
    reporting "not found" for a wrong guess is worse than just fetching the whole
    document and reading the right field.

    Provide one or more of the following. Each is a list of sub-document paths using
    Couchbase's dot/bracket path syntax (e.g. "address.city", "tags[0]", "tags[-1]" for
    the last array element):
    - get_paths: fetch the VALUE at each path.
    - exists_paths: check whether each path exists, without fetching its value (cheaper
      than get_paths — no payload transfer — when you only need a yes/no answer).
    - count_paths: get the number of elements in the array or object at each path (fails
      per-path if the path isn't an array/object).

    At least one of get_paths, exists_paths, or count_paths must be provided. As a rule of
    thumb, keep the combined number of paths across all three to 16 or fewer — Couchbase
    limits subdocument operations per call, though the exact limit is server-side and may
    change. If the server rejects the call (too many paths, or another constraint like path
    length or nesting depth), the whole call fails with {"error": "..."}.

    A path that doesn't exist (or otherwise fails, e.g. count on a non-array/object) does
    NOT fail the whole call — it is reported individually as {"error": ...} in the
    returned dict so the other requested paths can still be resolved.

    Returns a dict with a key for each category that was requested (only requested
    categories are included):
    {
        "get": {"<path>": {"value": <value>} | {"error": "..."}},
        "exists": {"<path>": {"value": true | false} | {"error": "..."}},
        "count": {"<path>": {"value": <count>} | {"error": "..."}},
    }
    On a connection/lookup failure, or an invalid request (no paths / too many paths),
    returns {"error": "<message>"} instead.

    Use this instead of upsert_document_by_id/replace_document_by_id when you only need to
    change, add, or remove a few fields — AND you already know the exact field path(s) to
    mutate (e.g. from a prior get_document_by_id or lookup_subdocument call, from the
    user explicitly naming the field, or from a known schema). Do NOT guess field paths.

    IMPORTANT — atomicity: a mutate_in call is all-or-nothing. If ANY requested spec fails
    (e.g. an insert on a path that already exists), the ENTIRE call fails and NONE of the
    mutations are applied — unlike lookup_subdocument, there is no partial success.

    Provide one or more of the following lists. Each path uses Couchbase's dot/bracket path
    syntax (e.g. "address.city", "tags[0]", "tags[-1]" for the last array element):
    - upsert_specs: [{"path": str, "value": <any JSON value>}, ...] — set the value at each
      path, creating the field if it doesn't exist.
    - insert_specs: [{"path": str, "value": <any JSON value>}, ...] — create the field at
      each path; fails if a path already exists.
    - replace_specs: [{"path": str, "value": <any JSON value>}, ...] — set the value at each
      path; fails if a path doesn't already exist.
    - remove_paths: [str, ...] — delete the field at each path; fails if a path doesn't exist.
    - array_append_specs / array_prepend_specs: [{"path": str, "values": [<any JSON value>,
      ...]}, ...] — add one or more values to the end/start of the array at each path.
    - array_insert_specs: [{"path": str, "values": [<any JSON value>, ...]}, ...] — insert
      one or more values at a specific array index; path must point at an index, e.g.
      "tags[2]".
    - array_add_unique_specs: [{"path": str, "value": <scalar: str|int|float|bool>}, ...] —
      add a scalar value to the array at each path only if it isn't already present; fails
      if the value is already in the array.
    - counter_specs: [{"path": str, "delta": int}, ...] — increment (delta >= 0) or
      decrement (delta < 0) the integer at each path by delta, returning the new value. If
      the field doesn't exist yet, it is created (and its parents, if create_parents=True).

    create_parents: if True, missing intermediate path segments are created automatically
    for every category except replace_specs and remove_paths, which always require the full
    path to already exist.

    At least one spec must be provided. As a rule of thumb, keep the combined number of
    specs across all categories to 16 or fewer — Couchbase limits subdocument operations
    per call, though the exact limit is server-side and may change. If the server rejects
    the call, the whole call fails with {"error": "..."} and nothing is mutated.

        "counter": {"<path>": {"success": true, "value": <new value>}},

    }
    On a connection/mutation failure, or an invalid request, returns {"error": "<message>"}
    instead and no mutations are applied.
